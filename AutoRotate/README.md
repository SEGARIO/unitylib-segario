## AUTO ROTATE

This Script allows you to __**rotate a GameObject**__ every frame on one or multiple axis.

It also Allows you to chose if you want to rotate it __**using the DeltaTime**__.

# HOW TO DO IT

## In your Scene:

1. **Select the GameObject** you want to **Rotate**.
2. Give that GameObject the **AutoRotate script**.



## In the Inspector:

1. **Select the axis** you want to Rotate by indicating the speed of each axe.
2. If you don't want an axe to rotate, **leave it with 0**.
3. Check the *usesDeltaTime* bool if you want it to **Rotate using the DeltaTime**.
